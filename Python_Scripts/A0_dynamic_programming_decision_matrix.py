""" The following program is based on the initial scenario of optimal foraging
from the 6th chapter of Roff, 2010.
Check the README.txt of the depository for more ecological context.

The main objective of this script is to compute a "decision matrix", given a
set of parameters that correspond to the biological context of the problem.
The decision matrix is simply a matrix with rows corresponding to time steps
and columns to the possible states in which an animal can be. Each matrix cell
(i.e. at a certain time step and a certain state) corresponds to the
identification number of the best patch an animal should choose if it wants to
maximise it's fitness (the final time step being the main goal).

The problem is solved using the principles of dynamic programming. Therefore,
the main objective, which is obtaining the decision matrix, is divided into
sub-problems. Algorithmically, each subproblem is translated into a function :

    function 'fitness' : The smallest sub-problem is to compute the fitness of
an animal if it forages on a specific patch (for a given time step and a given
state). In this specific problem, the fitness at a certain time step t is
computed based on the possible fitnesses of the time t+1. There is therefore
a need of knowing the final fitnesses to compute to whole decision matrix by
iterating backwards the computation of the fitnesses.

    function 'over_patches' : The second sub-problem is to choose the best
patch between all the patches the animal can choose from, at a certain time
step and in a certain state. The choice of the patch is based on the
maximization of the fitness.

    function 'over_states' : The third sub-problem is to obtain the best patch
for every state an animal can be in, for a specific time step.

The whole program therefore works as nested blocks : 'over_state' is iterated
for every time step and calls the function 'over_patches' that itself calls the
function 'fitness'.
