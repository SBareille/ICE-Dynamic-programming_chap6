""" The following program computes the "decision matrix" of the third
scenario of chapter 6 in Roff, 2010.
Check the README.txt of the depository for more ecological context.

The main objective of this script is to compute a "decision matrix", given a
set of parameters that corresponds to the biological context of the problem.
The decision matrix is simply a matrix with rows corresponding to time steps
and columns to the possible states in which an animal can be. Each matrix cell
(i.e. at a certain time step and a certain state) corresponds to the
identification number of the best patch an animal should choose if it wants to
maximise its fitness (the final time step being the main goal).

In this specific scenario, the problem is to know for a Lion if it should 
hunt in a pack or not in order to maximize its fitness, depending on
its gut content (the state of the animal) and the time step.
Therefore, in this context, the patch corresponds to the size of the pack
(from 1 to 4 animals).

Since values of gut content could be continuous and not discrete,
an interpolation method is implemented to obtain values of fitness depending
on the values of the closest precedent fitnesses.
